# Touple
# Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
# The major difference between 'Touple' and 'List' is Touple are immutable and  'List' are mutable

#Touple can contain different data type 

tuple1 = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
tuple2 = (1, 5, 7, 9, 3)
tuple3 = (True, False, False)
print(tuple1 , tuple2 , tuple3);


# Lets chk the datatype of the tuple

mytuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(type(mytuple))

print(len(tuple1));     #Way to check the length of the touple.
